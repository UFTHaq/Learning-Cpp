/*
    SMART POINTERS
    ====================================================================================
    Issue with Raw Pointers

    - C++ provides absolute flexibility with memory management
        - Allocation
        - Deallocation
        - Lifetime management

    - Some potentially serious problems
        - Uninitialized (wild) pointers
        - Memory leaks
        - Dangling pointers
        - Not exeption safe

    - Ownership?
        - Who owns the pointer?
        - When should a pointer be deleted?
