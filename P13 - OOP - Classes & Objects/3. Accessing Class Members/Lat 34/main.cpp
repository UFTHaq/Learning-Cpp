/*
    Creating and Accessing Objects

    We have already declared a C++ class named Dog that is located in Dog.h
    (we'll learn about header files later in this section)

    In the test_dog function create a Dog object named spot and, using the (.)
    operator, set the name attribute to the string "Spot" and the age attribute
    to 5.
*/

// #include "Dog.h"

// Dog test_dog() {
//     Dog spot;
//     spot.name = "Spot";
//     spot.age = 5;

//     return spot;
// }
