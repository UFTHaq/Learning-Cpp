/*
    C++ LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
    ====================================================================================
    Motivation

    - Prior to C++11
      - Function objects
      - Function pointers
      
      - We ofthen write many short functions that control algorithms
      - These short functions would be encapsulated in small classes to produce function objects
      - Many times the classes and functions are far removed from where they are used leading to
        modification, maintenance, and testing issues
      - Compiler cannot efficiently inline these functions for efficiency.
