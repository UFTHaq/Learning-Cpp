    POLYMORPHISM
    ===============================================================================================
    What is Polymorphism?

    - Fundamental to Object-Oriendted Programming

    - Polymorphism
        - Compile-time/early binding/static binding
        - Run-time/late binding/dynamic binding

    - Runtime Polymorphism
        - Being able to assign different meanings to the same function at run-time
    
    - Allows us to program more abstracly
        - Think general vs specific
        - Let C++ figure out which function to call at run-time

    - Not the default in C++, run-time polymorphism is achieved via
        - Inheritance
        - Base class pointers or references
        - virtual functions
