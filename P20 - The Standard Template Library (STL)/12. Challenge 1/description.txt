Challenge 1 - Deque

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards or forwards.
Simple examples are:
- madam
- bob
- toot
- radar

An entire phrase can also be a palindrome, for example:
A toyotas a toyotas
A santa at nasa
A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal-panama

For the purpose of this assignment we will only consider alpha characters and omit
all other characters.
We will also not be considering case.
so,
a santa at nasa will be processed as:
ASANTAATNASA

A common method to solve this problem is to compare the string to its reverse and if 
they are equal it must be a palindrome. But we will use a Deque.

I am providing the main driver for you which will automatically run several test cases.
Your challenge is to write the following funcion:

bool is_palindrome(const std::string &s) {}

This function will expect a string and it must determine if that string is a palindrome
and return true if it is, or false if it is not.

So,

is_palindrome("A santa at nasa") will return true.
is_palindrome("Hello") will return false

if you need a hint, please ask in the Q/A
Good luck and have fun
