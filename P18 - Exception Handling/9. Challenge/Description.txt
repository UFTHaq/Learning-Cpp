    CHALLENGE
    ===================================================================================
    For this challenge we want to integrate our own user-defined exception classes into
    the Account class hierarchy

    The account class are provided for you.
    Also, the IllegalBalanceException.h file contains the declaration for the
    IllegalBalanceException class.

    What i would like you to do is:
    1.  Derive IllegalBalanceException from std::exception and implement the what()
        method to provide an exception message.

        This excpetion object should be thrown from the Account class constructor
        if an account object is created with a negative balance.

    2.  Derive InsufficentFundException from std::exception and implement the what()
        method to provide an exception message.

        This exception object should be thrown if a withdraw results in a negative
        balance.

        You should throw this exception object from the Account withdraw method.

    That's it - good luck!
    Test your code in the main driver.

    Have fun and experiment!
